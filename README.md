## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
- [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
- [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
- [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
- [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
- [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
- [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
- [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
- [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
- [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
- [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   I did not use any outside resources. I only referred to the tutorial.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   One challenge I encountered when creating my submission was that my buttons were not lighting up when the sequence was playing.
   I could not figure out where the error in the code wasand spent a lot of time rereading my work to see where I missed something. After a few minutes,
   I realized that I did not include the tags for each of the buttons when calling button lit in my style sheet. Instead I copied and pasted one of calls
   and forgot to change it. This taught me to go slower in my coding because if I move too fast, I can forget simple changes like this. If I slowed down,
   I would have been able to catch that mistake earlier, which would have made it easier to find.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   I would like to learn more about JavaScript after completing this project. Although the language is very similar to other computer programming
   languages I have learned, there are still aspects of it that are unique to the language that I am interested in learning. I think by learning these aspects,
   it will overall improve my web development skills as I will be able to accomplish a lot more with my code as I would have been able to before. I also would like to
   go into more depth with HTML. Although I have some experience using it, I learned it a few years ago and would like to refresh my memory on all of the topics
   in order to help me in future projects.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would have tried to learn how to code this all on my own. I would have learned JavaScript a little more in depth
   then spent the time trying to work out the problem with my own solutions. I also would have added more features, like game modes and difficulties, which
   would have given users a more entertaining game experience.
